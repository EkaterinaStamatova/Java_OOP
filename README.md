# Java_OOP

My exam preparation for the Java OOP exam 2022. 

- The Java OOP course covered the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. It went into the most commonly used design patterns. Attention was payed to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
